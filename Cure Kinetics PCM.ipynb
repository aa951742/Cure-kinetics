This process of curing is described as the degree of cure $\\alpha$. Before any covalent bond is formed, the material exists solely out of monomers. In this case, it can be said that no convergence has happened and thus $\\alpha = 0$. After adding hardener, the bonding of these monomers begins to form polymer chains. Once all monomers are attached to a polymer chain, via the mentioned covalent bonds, it can be said that the degree of cure $\\alpha = 1$.\n",

Then, it can be assumed that the number of collisions between two neighboring reactents will increase as well. Since temperature is movement on the microscale, an increase in temperature will have an effect on the curing of the thermoset. Also, when more time is given to two reactants, the probability of a necessary collision for bonding increases.\n",
